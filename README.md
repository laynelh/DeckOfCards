# DeckOfCards
Card matching game using a simple API

# Overview
Hello there! This code is from a project I created a few years ago from start to finish. 
My goal was to utilize a simple API to create a game where each time you match two of the same cards, you recieve one point.
Once you match all cards that are displayed, you can generate a new deck until you go through all of the cards in your deck!
Although This game is certainly not completed nor exceptionally polished, the application is functional and effectively uses the API in a unique way.
